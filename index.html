    <p>Hello everyone. My name is Mubinjon Zokirov.  I am 13 years old and I'm in the 7th grade. I live in New York, Brooklyn. I have a mother, father and brother. I study in in New York city public school called "Edward B. Shallow 227." I'm new to the United States. It's almost my first year in here.</p>
